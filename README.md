# crypt_civilization

Crypt Creation

We're going to build ourselves a time capsule - like the Crypt of Civilization - using Ruby arrays!

Write a line of code that initializes an empty array called crypt_of_civilization

Show Solution

Crypt Filling

Now let's start adding items to the crypt_of_civilization!

Comptometer
Box of phonographic records
Plastic savings bank
Set of scales
Toast-O-Lator
Sample of aluminum foil
Donald Duck doll
What is a Toast-O-Lator you might ask? Video

For a full inventory of the time capsule, take a look here: What's inside the Crypt of Civilization?

Crypt Combining

Oh no! We forgot to add a few things to crypt_of_civilization! We have another array called extra that has the items we want:

extra = ["Container of beer", "Lionel model train set", "Ingraham pocket watch"]
After defining the extra array like we've done above, write a single line of Ruby code that combines the contents of crypt_of_civilization and extra into crypt_of_civilization.

Crypt Reference

Now let's grab a few values in the crypt_of_civilization variable. Write a single line of code to answer each of the following questions:

How many items are in the array?
What is the first item in the array?
What is the last item in the array?
What is the second item in the array?
What is the third item in the array?
What is the second from last item in the array?
What is the index of "Toast-O-Lator"?

Crypt Checking

Let's find out if our array crypt_of_civilization contains some items!

Write Ruby code to answer the following questions:

Does the array contain "Container of beer"?
Does the array contain "Toast-O-Lator"?
Does the array contain "Plastic bird"?
Show Solution

Crypt Sorting

Right now, the elements in our array are in a rather random order. Let's try sorting them in a couple of different ways.

Write Ruby code to sort the array as follows:

By word length
In alphabetical order
In reverse alphabetical order

Crypt Printing

Two hundred years have passed. Hoverboards STILL haven't been properly invented yet, but at least we can open up our time capsule and enjoy a well-aged container of beer!

Using a while loop, print out each element of the array crypt_of_civilization.

Then do the same with an each loop!

Crypt Deletion

After opening the time capsule we discovered that half of this stuff is junk! History won't mind if we get rid of a few relics.

Try to remove the following items from the array crypt_of_civilization:

the first item
the last item
"set of scales"
"sample of aluminum foil"
